values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks. The Alpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this:
