## What is TorchQuantum?

TorchQuantum is a highly scalable `single-factor` backtesting framework. It 
inherits from [WorldQuant](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators)
and its designed structure derives from Pytorch.

## Why TorchQuantum?
It is a integrated package that allows for factor mining. For example, the gplearn
is translated into the suitable format for TorchQuantum, and it admits the higher efficiency for
generating formulaic alphas.
